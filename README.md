### TECH: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind

Translating an object-based data structure into a visual, interactive interface was a great challenge. I made heavy use of useRef() in order to associate ui elements with their respective DS nodes, which allowed me to add or remove nodes with slick animations to keep the user engaged.

This was my first time trying Tailwind, and as a semantic CSS purist, it took several days of grumbling before it clicked. Now, I love Tailwind. Who coulda thunk?

Really enjoyed using Next.js for this project. I look forward to using it in future projects, it's a big step up from create-react-app.

DSAmazing is at an early stage. As time permits, potential future features include:
- More data structures, of course
- More visualizations to demonstrate exactly what is happening when a DS method is run

- Fell in love with Next.js
- Got cozy with Typescript. I can't imagine ever using vanilla JS again!
- Learned the ins and outs of Tailwind
- Figuring out how to translate object-based data structures into an interactive, visual interface was a great challenge

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
